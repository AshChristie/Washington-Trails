        <h2>Hiking at PooPoo Point</h2>
        <p>Poo Poo Point Trail is a 6.8 mile moderately trafficked out and back trail located near Issaquah, Washington that offers the chance to see wildlife and is rated as moderate. The trail is primarily used for hiking, walking, and trail running and is accessible year-round. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.</p>
        The traditional hiking trail begins at Issaquah High School. Pass the swampy area and the athletic fields on Second Avenue SE to the first sign. Keep right, heading up a gentle hill on an old railroad grade. You’ll soon enter Tiger Mountain State Park.

        At 0.9 miles you’ll encounter a power line and cross over a buried gas line. Then the route continues winding through a mix of deciduous and coniferous forests, crossing small creeks along the way. Look out for trillium, bleeding heart, and yellow violets in the spring, and for salmonberries and thimbleberries in the summer.

        The trail then brings you to a three-way junction at the top of the hill. Poo Poo Point is just half a mile further; first you’ll go down and then make another short climb to the north launch on top of the point.

        Since it gets them to the top (i.e. to the fun part) more quickly, hang gliders and paragliders take the shorter Chirico trail. This route starts on the eastern edge of their landing field, and goes up the steep “Yah-er Wall,” a forested hill ascended by switchbacks and stone steps. Going this way you’ll first encounter the south launch, which, on a clear day, offers views of Mount Rainier. The north launch and the top of Poo Poo Point is a quarter mile further.

      <p>Getting there: Take I-90 E to exit 17. Turn right onto Front St. (becomes Issaquah-Hobart Rd.). In 1.5 miles turn left onto 2nd Ave.  Immediately on the right is a small gravel parking lot that is the trailhead.
